## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main entry point of the application"),
    ("cli.py", "CLI class for handling user interactions"),
    ("database.py", "Database class for managing appointments in SQLite"),
    ("appointment.py", "Appointment class for representing appointment objects"),
    ("sms.py", "SMS class for sending SMS notifications using Twilio"),
    ("call.py", "Call class for making phone calls using Twilio")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
- `main.py` depends on `cli.py`
- `cli.py` depends on `database.py`, `sms.py`, and `call.py`
- `database.py` depends on `appointment.py`
- `sms.py` and `call.py` depend on external Twilio library

## Task list:

```python
[
    "appointment.py",
    "database.py",
    "sms.py",
    "call.py",
    "cli.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

The tasks should be done in the following order:
1. Implement `appointment.py`
2. Implement `database.py` (depends on `appointment.py`)
3. Implement `sms.py` and `call.py` (depends on external Twilio library)
4. Implement `cli.py` (depends on `database.py`, `sms.py`, and `call.py`)
5. Implement `main.py` (depends on `cli.py`)

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'database.py' file contains the implementation of the Database class, which is responsible for managing appointments in SQLite. It uses the Appointment class from 'appointment.py' to represent appointment objects.

The 'sms.py' file contains the implementation of the SMS class, which is responsible for sending SMS notifications using the Twilio package.

The 'call.py' file contains the implementation of the Call class, which is responsible for making phone calls using the Twilio package.
